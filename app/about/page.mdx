I'm Quan. I built this website because seeing my Focusmate stats gives me a lot of motivation and helps me appreciate the progress I've made.

I hope it works the same magic for you, too.

This website will be 100% free forever. Why?

- Its maintanence cost is low, totaling less than $11/year.
- The Focusmate community has helped me navigate through multiple stressful periods working remotely and a career transition. This is a thank you.
- I love building applications. It's fun!

Want to support? Here is a few ways:

- If you're on GitHub, I'd appreciate a star and/or your contributions <LinkExternal href="https://github.com/qu8n/focusbeacon" openInNewTab>here</LinkExternal>.
- Let others know about this website. One of my Focusmate friends mentions it on her Focusmate profile (thanks, Louisa!).
- Let me know if you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions <LinkExternal href="https://forms.gle/D7k33QwMUzK2m1vb7" openInNewTab>here</LinkExternal>.

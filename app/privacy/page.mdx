- Your time zone: lets us understand the overall user demographics of FocusBeacon.
- Your current daily streak: for our upcoming leaderboard feature that privately lets you know where you stand among other FocusBeacon users.

What's more, FocusBeacon is an <LinkExternal href="https://github.com/qu8n/focusbeacon" openInNewTab>open-source project</LinkExternal>, meaning anyone can inspect the code that runs this website, ensuring transparency.
